In October, the band got in the studio to craft the 6-track Moon Shiner EP, a live debut record to be released February 1, 2016. Jenner and Raph met and started playing music together while fresh-faced undergraduates at Yale University in New Haven, CT. In their second tour together, Odell Fox won the band showcase at the American River Music Festival, giving them the opportunity to play an opening set on the main stage. The soon to be one-year-old band will kick off its Moon Shiner EP release tour at the Song and Surf Music Festival on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, then venture down the West coast and eventually end in their new home in Austin.","modified":"2016-02-27 07:54:45","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Odell Fox","venue_address":"1221 State Street Suite 205","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/026/153/824-2.jpeg_/odell-fox-24.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/026/153/824-2.jpeg_/odell-fox-24.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/026/153/824-2.jpeg_/odell-fox-24.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/026/153/824-2.jpeg_/odell-fox-24.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-01-06 07:28:04","venue_id":"V0-001-001277896-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"SOhO Restaurant and Music Club","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/santabarbara/venues/soho-restaurant-and-music-club-/V0-001-001277896-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"}]}}
